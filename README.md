SIMPLE SCRIPT TO INSTALL AND UPDATE VSOCDE

this script will download the vscode x64 version for linux 
then put it in a directory named "vscode" in your home folder.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
please make sure that there is no important data in the "~/vscode" directory
before running this script because it will erase all the data inside that directory to make a fresh new install .
